READ CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE

This End-User license Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement 
between (a) you (either an individual or a single entity) and (b) HP Inc. 
("HP") that governs your use of any Software Product, installed on or 
made available by HP for use with your HP product ("HP Product"), that 
is not otherwise subject to a separate license agreement between you 
and HP or its suppliers. Other software may contain a EULA in its online 
documentation. The term "Software Product" means computer software 
and may include associated media, printed materials and "online" or 
electronic documentation. 

An amendment or addendum to this EULA may accompany the HP 
Product.

RIGHTS IN THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE OFFERED ONLY ON THE 
CONDITION THAT YOU AGREE TO ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF 
THIS EULA. BY INSTALLING, COPYING, DOWNLOADING, OR 
OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, YOU AGREE TO BE 
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE 
LICENSE TERMS, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO RETURN THE ENTIRE 
UNUSED PRODUCT (HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE) WITHIN 14 DAYS 
FOR A REFUND SUBJECT TO THE REFUND POLICY OF YOUR PLACE OF 
PURCHASE. 

1. GRANT OF LICENSE.  HP grants you the following rights provided 
you comply with all terms and conditions of this EULA:

a. Use.  You may use the Software Product on a single computer ("Your 
Computer"). If the Software Product is provided to you via the internet 
and was originally licensed for use on more than one computer, you 
may install and use the Software Product only on those computers. You 
may not separate component parts of the Software Product for use on 
more than one computer. You do not have the right to distribute the 
Software Product. You may load the Software Product into Your

Software Product.

b. Storage.  You may copy the Software Product into the local memory 
or storage device of the HP Product.

c. Copying.  You may make archival or back-up copies of the Software 
Product, provided the copy contains all of the original Software 
Product's proprietary notices and that it is used only for back-up 
purposes.

d. Reservation of Rights.  HP and its suppliers reserve all rights not 
expressly granted to you in this EULA.

e. Freeware.  Notwithstanding the terms and conditions of this EULA, all 
or any portion of the Software Product which constitutes non-
proprietary HP software or software provided under public license by 
third parties ("Freeware"), is licensed to you subject to the terms and 
conditions of the software license agreement accompanying such 
Freeware whether in the form of a discrete agreement, shrink wrap 
license or electronic license terms accepted at time of download. Use of 
the Freeware by you shall be governed entirely by the terms and 
conditions of such license.

f. Recovery Solution.  Any software recovery solution provided with/for 
your HP Product, whether in the form of a hard disk drive-based

only be used for restoring the hard disk of the HP Product with/for 
which the recovery solution was originally purchased. The use of any 
Microsoft operating system software contained in such recovery 
solution shall be governed by the Microsoft License Agreement.

2. UPGRADES.  To use a Software Product identified as an upgrade, 
you must first be licensed for the original Software Product identified 
by HP as eligible for the upgrade. After upgrading, you may no longer 
use the original Software Product that formed the basis for your 
upgrade eligibility. By using the Software Product, you also agree that 
HP may automatically access your HP Product when connected to the 
internet to check the version or status of certain Software Products and 
may automatically download and install upgrades or updates to such 
Software Products on to your HP Product to provide new versions or 
updates required to maintain the functionality, performance, or security 
of the HP Software and your HP Product and facilitate the provision of 
support or other services provided to you. In certain cases, and 
depending on the type of upgrade or update, notifications will be 
provided to you (via pop-up or other means), which may require you to 
initiate the upgrade or update.

3. ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE. This EULA applies to updates or 
supplements to the original Software Product provided by HP unless 
HP provides other terms along with the update or supplement. In case 
of a conflict between such terms, the other terms will prevail.

4. TRANSFER.

a. Third Party.  The initial user of the Software Product may make a 
one-time transfer of the Software Product to another end user. Any 
transfer must include all component parts, media, printed materials, 
this EULA, and if applicable, the Certificate of Authenticity. The transfer 
may not be an indirect transfer, such as a consignment. Prior to the 
transfer, the end user receiving the transferred product must agree to 
all the EULA terms. Upon transfer of the Software Product, your license 
is automatically terminated.

b. Restrictions.  You may not rent, lease or lend the Software Product or 
use the Software Product for commercial timesharing or bureau use.

and conditions you consent to the collection and use of anonymous

b. Collection/Use by Third Parties.  Certain software programs included 
in your HP Product are provided and separately licensed to you by third 
party providers (�Third Party Software�). Third Party Software may be

technical system attributes and ensure that the most current version of 
the software has been installed on your system. If you do not want the 
Third Party Software to collect this technical information or

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT 
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, HP AND ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT �AS IS� AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND HEREBY 
DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, AND CONDITIONS,

IMPLIED WARRANTIES, DUTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND OF LACK OF VIRUSES ALL WITH REGARD 
TO THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow 
exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on the duration of implied 
warranties, so the above disclaimer may not apply to you in its entirety.
IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND, THE SOFTWARE COMES WITH 
GUARANTEES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER AUSTRALIAN AND 
NEW ZEALAND CONSUMER LAWS. AUSTRALIAN CONSUMERS ARE 
ENTITLED TO A REPLACEMENT OR A REFUND FOR A MAJOR FAILURE 
AND COMPENSATION FOR OTHER REASONABLY FORESEEABLE LOSS

HAVE THE SOFTWARE REPAIRED OR REPLACED IF IT FAILS TO BE OF 
ACCEPTABLE QUALITY AND THE FAILURE DOES NOT AMOUNT TO A 
MAJOR FAILURE. NEW ZEALAND CONSUMERS WHO ARE PURCHASING 
GOODS FOR PERSONAL, DOMESTIC OR HOUSEHOLD USE OR 
CONSUMPTION AND NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF A BUSINESS (�NEW 
ZEALAND CONSUMERS�) ARE ENTITLED TO REPAIR, REPLACEMENT OR

REASONABLY FORESEEABLE LOSS OR DAMAGE.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  Subject to local law, notwithstanding 
any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of HP and any of 
its suppliers under any provision of this EULA and your exclusive 
remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the greater of the 
amount actually paid by you separately for the Software Product or U.S.

NO EVENT SHALL HP OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR 
LOSS OF PROFITS OR CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER INFORMATION, FOR 
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, FOR PERSONAL INJURY, FOR LOSS OF 
PRIVACY ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, OR OTHERWISE IN 
CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS EULA, EVEN IF HP OR 
ANY SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES AND EVEN IF THE REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL 
PURPOSE. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or 
limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above 
limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
