(A long, heartfelt ode to Configuration Manager Task Sequences and Operating System Deployment)  
(Verse 1)
Oh, Configuration Manager, you're my guiding star,
In the world of IT, you’ve raised the bar.
From the server room to the client’s screen,
You roll out Windows like a well-oiled machine.
Task sequences hummin’ through the network’s veins,
Pushing bits and bytes through the digital plains.
Operating System Deployment, it’s a beautiful art,
You patch the world and you steal my heart.  
Got my PXE boot ready, BIOS is set,
WIM files loaded, no need to fret.
From bare metal to a desktop dream,
You build the future with a deployment stream.
With variables and drivers, you make it flow,
Task sequence steps, yeah, they steal the show.
SCCM, you’re the king of the IT parade,
With every image, a masterpiece made.  
(Chorus)
Oh, Task Sequence Blues, you keep me up at night,
Configuring steps ‘til the morning light.
From disk partition to app install,
Operating System Deployment, you answer the call.
With a WDS server and a network so grand,
You roll out Windows across the land.
Task Sequence Blues, you’re my guiding flame,
Configuration Manager, forever my game.  
(Verse 2)
Let’s talk about drivers, oh, what a chore,
Matching models, versions, and so much more.
You organize packages, keep ‘em neat in a row,
With a driver catalog, you make it go.
Condition steps, oh, you’re so precise,
WMI queries, yeah, they roll so nice.
If it’s a laptop or a desktop rig,
You find the right driver with a logical dig.  
Then there’s the boot image, the heart of the start,
WinPE loads up, it’s a work of art.
With a network stack and a command-line trick,
You stage the OS, and you do it quick.
But when errors hit, oh, the logs I’ll read,
SMSTS.log, my heart starts to bleed.
Exit code 0x80070032, what’s that mean?
Task Sequence Blues, you’re a troubleshooter’s dream.  
(Chorus)
Oh, Task Sequence Blues, you keep me up at night,
Configuring steps ‘til the morning light.
From disk partition to app install,
Operating System Deployment, you answer the call.
With a WDS server and a network so grand,
You roll out Windows across the land.
Task Sequence Blues, you’re my guiding flame,
Configuration Manager, forever my game.  
(Bridge)
Multicast or unicast, you choose the way,
MDT integration, yeah, it saves the day.
Custom scripts in PowerShell, they run so clean,
Task sequence variables, you’re the IT queen.
From sysprep to capture, you make it right,
Building gold images in the dead of night.
With boundaries and site codes, you keep it tight,
Configuration Manager, you’re my guiding light.  
But when it fails, oh, the pain is real,
F8 for the logs, gotta keep it chill.
Check the network, check the DP,
Distribution Point, don’t fail on me.
Reboot loops and missing files,
Task Sequence Blues, you test my wiles.
But when it works, oh, the joy I feel,
A perfect deployment, it’s a big deal.  
(Verse 3)
Let’s talk applications, layered on with care,
From Office to Adobe, you get ‘em there.
Supersedence rules and detection scripts,
You handle it all with a few quick clicks.
User state migration, you save the day,
USMT grabs the data and sends it away.
From old PC to new, it’s a seamless glide,
Task Sequence Blues, you’re my source of pride.  
Zero-touch installs, oh, what a dream,
No tech on-site, just a data stream.
With a task sequence engine, you run the show,
From Windows 10 to 11, you make it grow.
Collections and queries, you group ‘em right,
Target the clients in the middle of the night.
Configuration Manager, you’re the one I trust,
For OS deployment, you’re a must.  
(Chorus)
Oh, Task Sequence Blues, you keep me up at night,
Configuring steps ‘til the morning light.
From disk partition to app install,
Operating System Deployment, you answer the call.
With a WDS server and a network so grand,
You roll out Windows across the land.
Task Sequence Blues, you’re my guiding flame,
Configuration Manager, forever my game.  
(Outro)
So here’s to the admins, the IT crew,
Who live and breathe the Task Sequence Blues.
From the SCCM console to the client’s screen,
You build the systems that make the dream.
Operating System Deployment, it’s a labor of love,
With ConfigMgr, you rise above.
Task Sequence Blues, you’ll always be,
The heartbeat of IT, the song for me.
